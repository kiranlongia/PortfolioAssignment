          <p>Life is beautiful but not always easy, it has problems, too,
             and the challenge lies in facing them with courage, letting the beauty 
             of life act like a balm, which makes the pain bearable, during trying times, 
             by providing hope .Happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat, day-night are the two 
             sides of the me coin. Similarly life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success
              and comfort punctuated by misery, defeat, failures and problems. There is no human being
             on Earth, strong, powerful, wise or rich, who has not experienced, struggle, suffering
              or failure.</p>
              <p>
               Difficulties test the courage, patience, perseverance and true character of a human being. 
               Adversity and hardships make a person strong and ready to face the challenges of 
               life with equanimity. There is no doubt that there can be no gain without pain.
             It is only when one toils and sweats it out that success is nourished and sustained.

             Thus, life is and should not be just a bed of roses; thorns are also a part of it and
           should be accepted by us just as we accept the beautiful side of life.

              The thorns remind one of how success and happiness can be evasive and thus not to feel 
               disappointed and disheartened rather remember that the pain of thorns is short-lived, and 
               the beauty of life would soon overcome the prick of thorns.
